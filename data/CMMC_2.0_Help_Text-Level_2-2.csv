Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including mission/business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive.</p><p>As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations and is linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle or remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification/reporting of suspicious activities from external and internal sources. User response activities also includes incident response assistance which may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access to forensics services or consumer redress services, when required.</p><p>NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling. SP 800-86 and SP 800-101 provide guidance on integrating forensic techniques into incident response.

Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports. Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization.Suspected security incidents may also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, and policies.</p><p>NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling.</p><h3><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">CMMC CLARIFICATION</span></h3><p>Incident handling is the actions the organization takes to prevent or contain the impact of an incident to the organization while it is occurring or shortly after it has occurred. The majority of the process consists of incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery. During this process, it is essential to track the work processes required in order to effectively respond. Designate a central hub to serve as the point to coordinate, communicate, and track activities. The hub should receive and document information from system administrators, incident handlers, and others involved throughout the process. As the incident process moves toward eradication, executives, affected business units, and any required external stakeholders should be kept aware of the incident in order to make decisions affecting the business. Report to designated authorities, taking into account applicable laws, directives, regulations, and other guidance. Specify staff responsible for communicating about the incident to internal and external stakeholders.</p><h3><h3><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Example </span></h3></h3><p>You notice unusual activity on a server and determine a potential security incident has occurred. You open a tracking ticket with the Security Operations Center (SOC), which assigns an incident handler to work the ticket [a]. The handler investigates and documents initial findings, which lead to a determination that unauthorized access occurred on the server [b]. The SOC establishes an incident management team consisting of security, database, network, and system administrators. The team meets daily to update progress and plan courses of action to contain the incident [a]. At the end of the day, the team provides a status report to IT executives [d,f]. Two days later, the team declares the incident contained. The team produces a final report as the database system is rebuilt and placed back into operation.</p><h3><p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Potential Assessment Considerations </span></h3></p><ul><li>Is there an incident response policy that directs the establishment of requirements for tracking and reporting of incidents involving CUI to appropriate officials [a,d]?</li><li>Is cybersecurity incident information promptly reported to management [e,f]?46</li></ul><h3><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">REFERENCES</span></h3><ul><li>NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 3.6.2</li></ul>"
