Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.

When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the request on the user&rsquo;s behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the employee go to the website. A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and resources stored on the company&rsquo;s network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet from passing through an outside &ldquo;fence&rdquo; to the company&rsquo;s networks and information systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and protecting the data that can leave that boundary.
